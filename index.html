                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I have 20 years of software development experience primarily in the Java ecosystem. In the last 3 years I have developed a keen interest in Front-end development and would love to shift my attention there using React, Vue.js or Angular. I believe this would blend my love of development with my interest in artistic pursuits perfectly. At the same time, I am happy to develop on the full stack which would leverage my experience.</p>
                        
                    <p>Throughout my career, I've developed and maintained numerous successful enterprise web applications. I have experience with all facets of the software development life cycle including requirements gathering, system design, implementation, CI/CD, deployment, testing, and maintenance.</p>
                        
                    <p>My approach is to learn all I can about the area I am working with in an application whether REST best practices, Vuetify components, or SpringBoot conventions. I then apply this to the project and communicate it to my teammates. I am not afraid to ask questions and have historically been involved in technology communities in order to stay up to date and have a knowledge base to use when needed. I value the benefits of Pair Programming and have several years of experience working remotely. I have worked in teams where fast delivery was a must.</p>
